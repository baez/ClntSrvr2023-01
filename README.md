# ClntSrvr2023-01

ClntSrvr2023-01 is a C# project dedicated to exploring the client-server paradigm through multiple communication protocols. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing different protocols, including HTTP, TCP/IP, and WebSockets, demonstrating how clients and servers interact in each context.

## Features

- **HTTP Communication**: Implements RESTful APIs to facilitate client-server interactions over the HTTP protocol.
- **TCP/IP Sockets**: Provides examples of low-level socket programming to establish reliable connections and data exchange.
- **WebSockets**: Demonstrates real-time, full-duplex communication between client and server using WebSockets.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes asynchronous programming patterns to handle non-blocking I/O operations, enhancing performance and scalability.

## Project Structure

- `ConsoleApp1/`: A console application serving as a client or server in various protocol implementations.
- `DataModels/`: Defines data structures used for communication between clients and servers.
- `DocumentAPIClient/`: Contains client implementations that interact with document-based APIs.
- `DocumentClientConsole/`: A console-based client application for document services.
- `DocumentService/`: Implements server-side logic for handling document-related requests.
- `ExampleAPI/`: Provides example implementations of APIs using different protocols.
- `Interfaces/`: Declares interfaces to promote code modularity and testability.
- `Repositories/`: Implements data access layers following repository patterns.
- `TCPClient/`: Contains implementations of clients using the TCP/IP protocol.
- `TCPServer/`: Houses server-side code for handling TCP/IP client connections.
- `WebPageServerApp/`: A web server application serving HTML pages to clients.
- `WebServerApp/`: Implements a basic web server handling HTTP requests and responses.
- `.gitattributes` & `.gitignore`: Configuration files for Git version control.
- `ClntSrvr2023-01.sln`: Visual Studio solution file for managing the project.
